The plant does not permanently compromise the achievement of good status/potential in any of the water bodies in the same river basin district.</p><p>3.5. In addition to the mitigation measures referred to above, and where relevant, compensatory measures are implemented to ensure that the project does not increase the fragmentation of water bodies in the same river basin district. This is achieved by restoring continuity within the same river basin district to an extent that compensates the disruption of continuity, which the planned hydropower plant may cause.
